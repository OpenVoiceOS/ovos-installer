Open Voice OS has three main release channels:

  - stable (stable but old)
  - testing (recommended)
  - alpha (bleeding edge)

The stable channel changes the least and is the most conservative option, but may lag behind new features and fixes.

The testing channel is recommended for most users. It includes newer features and improvements and is generally stable, but may occasionally include regressions.

The alpha channel is the most experimental version, containing the latest features and changes that are still in development. It may be unstable and is not recommended for everyday use.

Please select a channel:
